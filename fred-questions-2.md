##Fred Questions 2

###what is the units for the temperature range of the base station (page 4)? either way, it seems like a wider range than is typical for electronic devices
The units for temperature is supposed to be Fahrenheit but I think we mistakenly forgot to mention that in the report sometimes. Nonetheless this is the goal for the base station and I think we will be constraining the temperature range as we move forward.

###Should check that the servo has sufficient torque to operate the deadbolt (especially at the end of battery life)?
So far through our tests, we have noticed that the servo does have sufficient torque to manipulate the deadbolt. The only issue moving forward is the reduce in torque has battery life decreases. But we hope to circumvent this by accurately representing the battery life span to the users as they use it and reducing battery consumption.

###a backup battery can be added to the raspberry PI without too much effort if needed
That's a great suggestion! We will look into it and include it into the base station as a precautionary measure.

###the environmental specs usually mean that the device must operate in an environment of that ambient temperature - the internal parts like power regulators and the CPU will get hotter than ambient.
Duly noted, we will make sure to better address this in the future reports.

###testing timeframe could be better defined

###Also, do you guys need anything special for the open-house demonstration. Normally most groups get their own (decently sized) table. Were you planning on bringing anything large, like a complete door?
For the open-house we will be bringing our own table and detailed poster. In addition, to demo our product we have purchased a small wooden door panel that will act as a complete door. The KiWi Smart Lock will be attached to it and showcase the automation.
