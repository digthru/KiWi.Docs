<h1>Batteries</h1>

<p>We want our smart lock to be powered as long as possible without the batteries having to be replaced, 

therefore sacrificing longevity for the ability to recharge (rechargeable batteries self-drain more quickly, 

up to 5% a month for even the better ones available) would be a bad idea.   Rechargeable batteries are 

This rules out rechargeable batteries for this application.</p>

<p><b>4x AA 1.5V Alkaline Batteries</b></p>

<p>Long lasting (around 2500 mAh)</p>

<p>Easily obtainable</p>

<p>Relatively inexpensive (around  $10 for 20 batteries)</p>

<p>Most commonly used for low drain applications</p>

<p><b>4x AAA 1.5V Alkaline Batteries</b></p>

<p>Much lower lifespan (about 800 mAh)</p>

<p>The AA’s much larger capacity means that it holds a clear advantage over the AAA for this project, where longevity is a key goal</p>

<p>Smaller size may be a benefit, if we are trying to optimize for space</p>

<p>Around the same price as AAs</p>

<p><b>4x LR44 1.5V Alkaline Batteries</b></p>

<p>Much smaller in size, but also significantly lower capacity (about 150 mAh), won’t achieve desired

longevity with these batteries.</p>

<p><b>4x C 1.5V Alkaline Batteries</b></p>

<p>Larger capacity (around 8000 mAh), but also much larger in size.   Typically used for medium-drain 

applications, not low drain such as ours.</p>

<p>Also more expensive than AA/AAA batteries (about $13 for 12 batteries)</p>

<p>After observing a number of smart locks currently on the market, they almost all use four 1.5V AA batteries.</p>

<p>I checked the websites of the Smart Lock brands we mentioned in our reports:</p>

<p>Lockitron - 4 AA batteries</p>

<p>Kevo - 4 AA batteries</p>

<p>August - 4 AA batteries</p>

<p>In conclusion, if we wish to remain competitive in terms of longevity, then 4 AA batteries would be the 

optimal choice for the power supply, if there is sufficient space for them.</p>

<p>The AA battery is the best suited to our application in terms of storage, availability, and price.</p>
